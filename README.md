# LichessConsoleBot

This is a small console application I aim to adapt for purposes of testing Master of Chess's bots.

Right now it plays random moves - the most basic bot possible (and the worst!)

If you want to use it and improve it for your own bots, create a lichess personal access token and put it in `appsettings.json` file which you need to create in root folder.
